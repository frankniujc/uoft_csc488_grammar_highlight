## Installation

To install, place this folder in the Packages directory of your sublime
installation. On linux this is typically in `~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages`.

## Quick Disclaimer

This is based off of the (kind of vague) specification handed out on the first
day of class, so please report any errors you encounter in the
[issues](https://github.com/Adjective-Object/488-lang/issues) of this repo.

# Syntax Hilighting for other editors
## Vim
Someone implemented vim syntax highlighting rules for the 2012 version of this 
course. I don't know how much the language's semantics have changed since then,
but if you are interested in it, it's available in
[podrezo's gist][vim-syntax-highlighting], and can be installed with 
[these directions on his github][vim-install-directions].
